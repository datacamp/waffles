# Design Tokens

Design tokens are the smallest design system atoms. They are named entities that store visual design attributes and are crucial to keeping designs consistent. They are used in place of hardcoded values, such as HEX color codes for color or pixel values for spacing.

This is the complete set of official DataCamp design tokens. Ideally, these are the only values you would need to use in the DataCamp project, when creating custom components.

## Colors

Functionally use color to show intent. It's great to have the content not only beautiful but also usable.

For **text** usually use `navy` color to achieve the best contrast against light backgrounds or `white` for dark backgrounds. There are also a few special colors defined to be used for text only, e.g. `redDarkText`. It is always a good idea to test text and background color contrast to meet [WCAG 2.1 level AA accessibility requirements](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum). There are various [tools](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/) to perform such checks.

For **background** mainly use `white`, `beigeSubtle`, and on rare occasions `navy`.

For **accessibility** hints, such as focus style, use `navyDark`.

For **social media** related content be free to use one of the `brand` colors, e.g. `brandLinkedIn`.

There are [a few helpers](/components/helpers) available in Waffles for advanced colors adjustments, such as changing color opacity or darkening it.

<DesignTokensTable tokensGroup="colors" />

## Sizing

Use for both width and height of the action elements, such as buttons.

<DesignTokensTable tokensGroup="sizing" />

## Spacing

Use for padding, margins, and position coordinates. Use `small` between buttons in group.

<DesignTokensTable tokensGroup="spacing" />

## Border Width

Use to define element border thickness.

<DesignTokensTable tokensGroup="borderWidth" />

## Border Radius

Use to define element corner roundness.

<DesignTokensTable tokensGroup="borderRadius" />

## Box Shadow

Use to show drop shadow beneath element.

<DesignTokensTable tokensGroup="boxShadow" />

## Font Families

For regular text use `sansSerif`, and for code samples `mono`.

<DesignTokensTable tokensGroup="fontFamilies" />

## Font Sizes

Use to define font size. For regular text use `medium`.

<DesignTokensTable tokensGroup="fontSizes" />

## Font Weights

Use to change how thin or heavy the weight of the font is.

<DesignTokensTable tokensGroup="fontWeights" />

## Letter Spacing

Use to adjust the distance between text characters.

<DesignTokensTable tokensGroup="letterSpacing" />

## Line Heights

Use to set the distance between lines of text. For long blocks of text use `relaxed`. For short paragraphs be free to use `default`. For one-liners, such as labels, use `tight`.

<DesignTokensTable tokensGroup="lineHeights" />

## Opacity

Use to change element transparency. For muted colors rather use predefined color tokens, over setting opacity.

<DesignTokensTable tokensGroup="opacity" />

## Z-index

Use to set the layering order of the common elements.

<DesignTokensTable tokensGroup="zIndex" />

## Breakpoints

Breakpoints for various device sizes. For **media queries** use [mediaQuery](/components/helpers) helper.

<DesignTokensTable tokensGroup="breakpoints" />
