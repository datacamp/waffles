# Hooks

ðŸš§ This page is **under construction**.

## useId

A lot of accessibility-related features rely heavily on element IDs. Manually providing such IDs is both cumbersome and error-prone. To aid with that the hook autogenerates **random ID** with a prefix.

<Example title="Basic Usage" path="hooks/use-id-basic-usage">
  <UseIdBasicUsage />
</Example>

## useMediaQuery

A hook to conditionally render component based on the viewport size. Following mobile-first approach, consider base return without conditional rendering to be the mobile one.

It determines, if there is a media query match for current viewport for each breakpoint from [design tokens](/foundation/design-tokens) (small, medium, large).

<Example title="Basic Usage" path="hooks/use-media-query-basic-usage">
  <UseMediaQueryBasicUsage />
</Example>
