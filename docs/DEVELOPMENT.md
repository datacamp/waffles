# Waffles 2.0 Local Development Guide

All **Waffles** components and their tests exist in the `src` directory, and their official documentation is in the `doc-site` folder. All npm scripts are run from the root – no need to navigate to subsequent directories.

To make the versioning and release process easier we use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). On each commit, code is formatted, and the commit message is verified whether it adheres to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.

The whole release process is fully automated. That's why proper commits messages are important.

## 💻 Before You Start

- Make sure you have a compatible version of **node** installed (14+)
- Install the latest version (1.22+) of **yarn** package manager
- Run **yarn** in the root directory to install all dependencies

## 🔧 Workbench

**Workbench** is a lightweight _local development environment_ created specifically for developing new components or updating the existing ones.

To start **Workbench** run `yarn workbench` npm script and navigate to `http://localhost:4040`. You will notice an empty canvas.

### Adding Component to Workbench

To add a component to **Workbench** navigate to `workbench/workbench.tsx` and import the component as you would in a regular application (let's use `button` example):

```js
import { Button } from '@datacamp/waffles/button';

function Workbench() {
  return <Button>Hello there!</Button>;
}

export default Workbench;
```

After that start modifying the imported component in `src/button` and the changes will be automatically reflected in the **Workbench** preview.

⚠️ When you're done, make sure to **NOT commit** `workbench/workbench.tsx` file and leave it pristine for other developers.

### Useful Commands for Local Components Development

- To run unit tests with jest run `yarn test-unit`
- To check for common coding errors run `yarn lint`
- To format code with prettier run `yarn format`
- To verify commits messages run `yarn lint-commits`

## 📄 Docs Website

Whenever you want to update official **Waffles** documentation run `doc:dev` npm script and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

Documentation is built in [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs) framework. All relevant pages are placed in `doc-site/pages` directory. For writing components' documentation, we use [mdx](https://mdxjs.com/), the flavor of markdown. It is accessible even for non-technical people.

You can find components used internally in `doc-site/components` folder.

## 🧪 Tests

> Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration.

In **Waffles** there are 2 kinds of tests to keep the codebase healthy and of high quality.

### Unit Tests

To run unit tests run `yarn test-unit` npm script.

Regular unit tests are placed in `__tests__` directory next to the component and have a `.spec.tsx` file extension. We are using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) test runner and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).

### Stories

To test stories use `yarn test-stories` command. Cypress test runner should open shortly, where, if you wish, you can inspect each story one by one.

Stories are the Waffle's _integration_ and _visual regression_ tests. Similar to unit tests they are placed next to the component in `__tests__` folder. Each **story** lives in a separate `.story.tsx` file and it should be added to the component's e2e test suite in the appropriate `.e2e.ts` file. We are using [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/) to run those tests. For example to load story placed in `basic-button.story.tsx` file just run `cy.vsit(stories/basic-button)`.

It is also possible to test for various **a11y violations** against [WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) by using `cy.a11yCheck()`.
