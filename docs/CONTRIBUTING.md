## I have a new component / style change / big feature

Whilst we would love for everyone to be able to contribute new components or styling updates etc, these major changes require design sign off and heavy consideration and so you are best off reaching out to us so we can discuss it first.

## I have a bug report / feature request / question

We are more than happy to help! The best way to report these bugs or create requests is to ping our team on slack or raise an issue through service desk.
